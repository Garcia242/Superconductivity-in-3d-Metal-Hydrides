This repository contains code examples and the data used in the project "Superconductivity in 3D Meatal Hydrides". 

For more information you can find the report and poster for this project here in the main page.

Contents Index:

Convex Hull analysis - contains the enthalpy data from every structure tested as well as the python code for the convex hull

DOS Analyis - contains the densities of states calculations performed as part of the phonon calculations

Example code - Example of the input codes used to perform our calculations

Final Structures - Contains the CONTCAR files for the outputs of the VASP structure optimazitation calculations for each structure

Input Structures - VASP input structures used 

Tc Calculations - python calculations used to calculate the Tc using the output the lambda file generate from the q2r calculation

Note: The test structure in MnH5 in Mn files refers to the test structure used to indetify what happened during the phase transition
